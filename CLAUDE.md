# Claude Code Guidelines for ThreadKit

## Development Rules

1. **No backwards compatibility hacks** - This project is in active development. Never add fallbacks, deprecated prop handling, or backwards compatibility code. Just make the change directly.

2. **No time estimates** - Don't provide time estimates for tasks.

3. **Direct changes only** - When making changes, just make them. Don't add migration paths, deprecation warnings, or support for old APIs.
